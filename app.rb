# puts "Hello world!"

#testing to see if this is printed out in terminal when using the ruby .app.rb call
# It totally did not :) This is the JavaScript equivalent of // to comment something out 


## 'puts' is a built in Ruby Method that will outpupt a string of text to the terminal.
# this is Rubys version of console.log()
# In Ruby, adding parenthesies 
# to invoke are optional as seen with the example above and below. 



## to runt he application, enter the command: ruby filename.rb || where filename.rb is the relative path to the 
# file you would like to run 
# Example: ruby app.rb 
# => Hello World!

# puts("Hello World!")

# ### Ruby Terminal Output Methods ####

# Outputting Strings with puts and print

# Ruby several methods for printing output to the terminal: puts, print, p, and pp.

# print and puts do almost the same thing; the only difference is that puts will add a line break at the end of the string. Try updating the code in app.rb to the following:

# # app.rb
# puts "Hello world!"
# puts "Hello world!"
# puts "Hello world!"
# puts "Hello World!"
# puts "Hello World!"
# puts "Hello World!"

# print "Hello World"
# print "Hello World"
# print "Hello World"

# print [1,2,3]

# # print seems to be the better way to go when viewing Arrays 

# puts [1,2,3]

# p [1,2,3]

# puts [1,2,3].inspect

# pp [{ id: 1, hello: "World" }, { id: 2, hello: "Ruby" }, { id: 3, hello: "Moon" }, { id: 4, hello: "Learner" }]


puts "Hello World!"

print "Pass this test, please."

p [1,2,3]
